    <h3>A delicious New York Style Pepperoni Pizza</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>*optional* Toppings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss the dough, streching it out as far as possible until a
                circle shape is formed. 
            </li>
            <li>Using a large spoon or ladle, spread the sauce almost all the way
                to the outside edge of the dough, going in circles. Leave about 1 inch
                around the entire edge untouched by sauce for your crust.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the cheese evenly, making sure to cover the pizza entirely so no
                large patches of sauce show through.
            </li>
            <li>Add toppings, if you so choose.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the oven and set a timer for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>At 6 minutes, turn the pizza in the oven 180 degrees, so the half
                that was in the back of the oven is now closest to the door.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the pizza and cut the pizza into eigths with 3 long diameter cuts.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
